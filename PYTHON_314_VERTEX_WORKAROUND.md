# Python 3.14 Beta + Vertex AI Compatibility Issue

## Problem
You're using **Python 3.14.0b1** (beta), which has compatibility issues with `pydantic-core` - a dependency of `google-cloud-aiplatform`. The package requires Rust compilation which fails on Python 3.14 beta.

## Quick Solutions (Choose One)

### Option 1: Use Conda with Python 3.11 (RECOMMENDED)

You're already in a `(base)` conda environment. Create a new environment with stable Python:

```bash
# Create new environment with Python 3.11
conda create -n vaultmind python=3.11 -y

# Activate it
conda activate vaultmind

# Install Vertex AI
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform google-auth

# Run Streamlit from this environment
streamlit run genai_dashboard_modular.py
```

### Option 2: Install Python 3.12 (Stable)

1. Download Python 3.12.x from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install it (check "Add to PATH")
3. Install packages:
   ```bash
   py -3.12 -m pip install google-cloud-aiplatform google-auth
   ```
4. Run Streamlit with Python 3.12:
   ```bash
   py -3.12 -m streamlit run genai_dashboard_modular.py
   ```

### Option 3: Try Older Vertex AI Version

Try installing an older version that has pre-built wheels:

```bash
py -m pip install google-cloud-aiplatform==1.38.0 google-auth==2.23.4
```

### Option 4: Use Your Working Vector Stores (NO SETUP NEEDED)

**You already have 3 working vector stores!** From your screenshot:

✅ **Pinecone** - Primary Store, Connected, 1 collection  
✅ **Weaviate** - Fallback Store, Connected, 5 collections  
✅ **FAISS** - Fallback Store, Connected, 2 collections  

**You can use these right now without any additional setup!**

---

## Why This Happens

Python 3.14 is still in **beta** (not stable). Many packages like `pydantic-core` don't have pre-compiled wheels for Python 3.14 yet, so pip tries to compile from source, which requires:
- Rust compiler
- C++ build tools
- Other compilation dependencies

This is common with beta Python versions.

---

## Recommended Approach

Since you're already using Conda, I recommend **Option 1** (create conda environment with Python 3.11):

```bash
# Quick setup
conda create -n vaultmind python=3.11 -y
conda activate vaultmind
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install google-cloud-aiplatform google-auth
streamlit run genai_dashboard_modular.py
```

This gives you:
- Stable Python version
- All packages work without compilation
- Isolated environment (won't affect your base environment)
- Easy to switch back: `conda deactivate`

---

## Alternative: Skip Vertex AI for Now

Your current setup is already excellent:
- **Pinecone**: Cloud-native, fast, already connected
- **Weaviate**: Scalable, already connected with 5 collections
- **FAISS**: Local, fast, no cloud costs

You can:
1. Continue using these vector stores
2. Come back to Vertex AI later when Python 3.14 is stable
3. Or set up Vertex AI in a Python 3.11 conda environment when needed

---

## Test If Installation Worked

After trying any solution, test with:

```bash
py -c "import google.cloud.aiplatform; print('✅ Installed:', google.cloud.aiplatform.__version__)"
```

If successful:
1. Restart Streamlit
2. Click "Reload Manager" 
3. Vertex AI should show green

---

## Summary

**Root cause**: Python 3.14 beta + pydantic-core compilation issue  
**Best fix**: Use conda environment with Python 3.11  
**Quick fix**: Use your existing Pinecone/Weaviate/FAISS stores  
**Future**: Wait for Python 3.14 stable release (packages will have pre-built wheels)
