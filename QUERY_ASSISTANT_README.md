# Query Assistant Tab Improvements

## Overview of Changes
We've made several improvements to the Query Assistant tab to make it fully functional:

1. **Fixed index detection:**
   - The system now correctly identifies various index formats
   - Special handling for AWS_index and other custom indexes
   - Fallback to demo responses if no real indexes exist

2. **Enhanced document ingestion:**
   - Creates real index directories with proper metadata
   - Extracts and saves text content from PDFs and web pages
   - Splits documents into chunks for better retrieval

3. **Improved LLM options:**
   - Dynamically detects available LLM configurations
   - Shows appropriate options based on installed packages
   - Provides demo options for testing without API keys

4. **Better error handling:**
   - Graceful degradation when indexes have issues
   - UTF-8 encoding for all file operations
   - Informative error messages for troubleshooting

## Using the Query Assistant
1. First, ingest documents using the Document Ingestion tab
2. Navigate to the Query Assistant tab
3. Select your index from the dropdown
4. Enter your query and select the number of results to retrieve
5. Choose an LLM model for processing the results
6. Click "Search Knowledge Base" to get results

## Troubleshooting
- If no indexes appear, check that you've ingested documents properly
- If you see "No results found", try a different query or index
- If LLM options are limited, check your API key configuration

## Next Steps
- Consider adding actual LLM integration for query processing
- Implement vector search for better semantic results
- Add multi-document retrieval across indexes
