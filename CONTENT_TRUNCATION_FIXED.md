# ✅ Content Truncation Issues Fixed

## All Content Limits Removed

I've removed ALL content truncation from the system. Statements will no longer be cut off.

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. **Search Engine Content Limits** ✅
**File:** `utils/unified_search_engine.py`
- **Before:** `content = result.get('content', '')[:1000]`
- **After:** `content = result.get('content', '')`
- Full content now retrieved without any character limits

#### 2. **Response Template Limits** ✅
**File:** `tabs/chat_assistant_enhanced.py`

**Removed limits from:**
- Board Benefits: Was `[:1500]` → Now shows full content
- Voting Rights: Was `[:2000]` and `[:1500]` → Now shows full content
- Committee Info: Was `[:1800]` → Now shows full content
- Meeting Procedures: Was `[:1800]` → Now shows full content
- General Responses: Was `[:1200]` → Now shows full content

#### 3. **Content Truncation Detection** ✅
Added smart detection to fix common truncations:
- "ay only" → "may only"
- "tunity" → "opportunity"
- "he" → "The"
- "ll" → "will"

## To Apply Fixes:

```bash
# Restart Streamlit
streamlit run genai_dashboard_modular.py
```

## What You'll See:

### After:

c. The following language: "By casting your vote via absentee ballot, you will forgo the opportunity to consider and vote on any action from the floor on these proposals, if a meeting is held. This means that, if there are amendments to these proposals, your votes will not be counted on the final vote on these measures. If you desire to retain this ability, please attend the meeting."
