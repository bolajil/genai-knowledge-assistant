- ❌ Heavy LLM calls on every query without optimization
- ❌ No query performance metrics or monitoring

### Functionality Issues
- ❌ Complex nested logic with code duplication
- ❌ Inconsistent error handling across search modes
- ❌ No query history or user analytics
- ❌ Limited result formatting and export options
- ❌ Poor user experience with long loading times

### Enterprise Standards Gaps
- ❌ Missing comprehensive audit logging
- ❌ No performance monitoring or alerting
