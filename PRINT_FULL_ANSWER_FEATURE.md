### Executive Summary

Board meetings require a quorum of directors to conduct business. Notice must be 
provided to all members and directors with the date, hour, place, and general 
subject of the meeting. The Class B Member has the right to disapprove certain 
actions taken by the Board.

### Detailed Answer

According to the Bylaws (Page 15), at all meetings of the Board, a majority of 
the directors constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business. The votes of 
a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present 
constitute the act of the Board.

Notice requirements are specified in Section 3 (Page 15), which states that 
Members and directors must be notified of the date, hour, place, and general 
subject of regular or special open Board meetings, including instructions for 
accessing any communication method utilized for the meeting.
