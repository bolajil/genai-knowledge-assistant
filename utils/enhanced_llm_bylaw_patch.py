Section 2. Board Meetings; Action Outside of Meeting
A Board meeting means a deliberation between a quorum of the voting directors or between
a quorum of the voting directors and another person, during which Association business is
considered and the Board takes formal action. A Board meeting does not include the gathering of
a quorum of the Board at a social function unrelated to the business of the Association or the
attendance by a quorum of the Board at a regional, state, or national convention, ceremonial event,
or press conference, if formal action is not taken and any discussion of Association business is
incidental to the social function, convention, ceremonial event, or press conference.
During the Development Period, Board meetings must be open to the Members only for
those items listed in subsection 2, below, subject to the right of the Board to adjourn a Board
meeting and reconvene in closed executive session. After the termination of the Development
Period, regular and special Board meetings must be open to the Members, subject to the right of
the Board to adjourn a Board meeting and reconvene in closed executive session.
Regarding all Board meetings that are open to the Members, whether such open meetings
occur during the Development Period or thereafter, Members other than directors may not
participate in any discussion or deliberation unless permission to speak is requested on their behalf
by a director. In such case, the President may limit the time any Member may speak.
An open meeting may be held by electronic or telephonic means, provided that (i) each
director may hear and be heard by every other director, (ii) all Members in attendance at the
meeting may hear all directors (except if adjourned to executive session), and (iii) all Members are
allowed to listen using any electronic or telephonic communication method used or expected to be
used by a director to participate.
Action Outside of a Meeting, Generally:
1. Subject to subsections 2 and 3, below, the Board may take action outside of a
meeting, including voting by electronic and telephonic means, without prior notice
to Members if each director is given a reasonable opportunity to express the
director's opinion to all other directors and to vote. Any action taken without notice
to the Members, including estimations of expenditures approved at the meeting,
must be summarized orally and documented in the minutes of the next
regular/special Board meeting.
Action Outside of a Meeting Prohibited:
2. Notwithstanding subsection 1, above, during the Development Period, a Board

## Limitations During Development Period

The document mentions that subsection 2 (not fully included in the excerpt) places limitations on actions that can be taken outside of meetings during the Development Period.

The text states: "Notwithstanding subsection 1, above, during the Development Period, a Board..." but the remainder of this limitation is not included in the available content.

This suggests there are specific restrictions or requirements for Board actions outside of meetings during the Development Period that differ from the general rules."""
