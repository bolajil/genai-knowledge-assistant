# Enhanced Agent Assistant Feature

## Overview
The enhanced Agent Assistant tab now supports multi-source search capabilities, enabling more comprehensive and accurate research. When information isn't available in the indexed documents, the agent can seamlessly search external sources to provide more robust answers.

## New Features

### Multi-Source Search
- Searches across multiple knowledge sources in parallel
- Combines results from indexed documents, web search, and structured data
- Intelligent prioritization of information from different sources
- Proper attribution of information to its original source

### Enhanced Research Generation
- Improved research report formats with dedicated sections for search results
- Support for Competitive Analysis and Market Research operations
- Better formatting and organization of information
- Clearer attribution of knowledge sources

### Configurable Knowledge Sources
- Ability to select which knowledge sources to use for each query
- External sources are used only when needed information isn't found in indexed documents
- Configuration options for source priorities and search parameters

## Configuration

You can configure the enhanced agent in `config/agent_config.py`:

```python
# Set to True to use the enhanced version with multi-source search
USE_ENHANCED_AGENT = True

# Configuration for multi-source search
MULTI_SOURCE_SEARCH_CONFIG = {
    "max_results_per_source": 5,
    "enable_web_search": True,
    "enable_structured_data": True,
    "enable_api_search": False,  # Set to True when API connectors are configured
    "search_timeout": 15,  # Maximum seconds to wait for search results
    "cache_results": True,  # Cache search results for improved performance
}
```

## Fallback Mechanism

If the enhanced modules are not available, the system will automatically fall back to the basic agent functionality, ensuring the application continues to work even if some components are missing.

## Usage

Use the Agent Assistant tab as before, but now with more powerful research capabilities. The agent will automatically leverage multiple knowledge sources when appropriate for the task.
