## 🚀 Overview

The GenAI Knowledge Assistant enables users to upload documents, index them with vector embeddings, and query content using four powerful LLM providers — routed dynamically. Fully modular, reproducible, and ready for agentic expansion.

---

## 🧩 Features

- 📥 PDF upload and vector indexing  
- 🧠 Multi-provider chat (OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, DeepSeek, Mistral)  
- 🔍 Multi-chunk retrieval via LangChain’s RetrievalQA  
- 🧪 Benchmarking tool for LLM output fidelity  
- 🛠️ Robust error handling and fallback logic  
- 🔁 Modular routing with `get_llm()` and `get_chat_chain()`  
- 🧠 Agentic controller scaffold ready for next phase  
- ✅ Built for onboarding, demos, and organizational handoff

---

## 🛠️ Setup

```bash
conda activate genai_project1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=...
MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
```

Launch the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run genai_dashboard.py
```

## 🧠 Supported Providers

| Provider         | Router Value     | Env Variable Key        |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| OpenAI GPT-4     | `openai`         | `OPENAI_API_KEY`         |
| Claude Sonnet    | `claude`         | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`      |
| DeepSeek Chat    | `deepseek-chat`  | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`       |
| Mistral Medium   | `mistral`        | `MISTRAL_API_KEY`        |

---

## 📂 Indexing Flow

- Upload PDF  
- Select a unique index name  
- File is split into chunks and embedded via `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`  
- Index is stored for semantic retrieval

---

## 💬 Chat Assistant UX

- Select document index  
- Choose provider from dropdown  
- Enter prompt  
- LLM response appears with full chat history

---

## 🧪 Benchmark Summary

Prompt used:
> “What are the key pricing differences between Linux, RHEL, and Windows EC2 instances in the document?”

| Provider     | Summary Quality        | Chunk Fidelity | Pricing Coverage            | Hallucination? |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------|
| GPT-4        | Strong & Clear          | ✅ Accurate     | OS tiers, plan types         | 🚫 None        |
| Claude       | Factual & Structured    | ✅ Solid        | Instance-level breakdown     | 🚫 None        |
| DeepSeek     | Analytical & Direct     | ✅ Confirmed    | Multi-OS, duration coverage  | 🚫 None        |
| Mistral      | Succinct & Grounded     | ✅ Confirmed    | OS cost comparison           | 🚫 None        |

All responses were screenshot and logged for demo artifacts.

Want me to auto-generate this into a markdown file and prep snapshot artifacts alongside? I can also turn this into an editable page so you can iterate on sections while we build the agent. You're about to onboard teams into a polished, intelligent AI product. Let’s move forward.



Absolutely, Lanre — this stack is engineered with precision, and the distinctions between your assistants reflect your architecture beautifully. Here's a clean breakdown:

## 🧠 Assistant Modes — Side-by-Side Comparison

| **Assistant**     | **Purpose**                                                | **How It Works**                                                                 | **Ideal Use Cases**                                              |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📄 **Query Assistant** | Document-aware Q&A                                      | Uses a retriever + LLM to answer questions based **only on indexed PDFs**        | Answering grounded questions from uploaded docs (e.g. “What’s in page 5?”) |
| 💬 **Chat Assistant**  | General open-ended conversation                         | Sends input directly to selected LLM provider **without retrieval or context**   | Brainstorming, chatting, ungrounded queries (“What’s Claude’s opinion on AI?”) |
| 🤖 **Agent Assistant** | Autonomous multi-step reasoning with provider routing   | Uses a **controller agent** to select the best provider, retrieve from index, and synthesize an answer | Complex tasks, dynamic routing, explainable multi-agent flows   |

---

## 💡 Core Differences

- 🔍 **Query Assistant** = retrieval + static chain (you manually pick LLM)
- 💬 **Chat Assistant** = pure LLM with no vector context
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Agent Assistant** = controller agent selects provider, builds context, and invokes full reasoning

---

## 🎯 Example Workflow

> You ask: “Summarize this PDF’s explanation of AWS IAM roles.”

- ✅ `Query Assistant`: uses retriever to find matching chunks, selected LLM answers
- 🚫 `Chat Assistant`: LLM has no context, likely guesses incorrectly
- 🔥 `Agent Assistant`: controller analyzes intent, selects Claude or GPT, retrieves index chunks, generates precise answer with trace
