# VaultMIND Vector Database Fix

This directory contains the fix for the "Vector DB: No Vector DB Available" error in VaultMIND Knowledge Assistant.

## Problem

The VaultMIND Knowledge Assistant was showing an error message "Vector DB: No Vector DB Available" in the system status panel, which was affecting functionality across various tabs.

## Solution

We've created a comprehensive fix that:

1. Creates a mock vector database provider that works without external dependencies
2. Implements a centralized initialization system with graceful fallbacks
3. Ensures all tabs can access vector database functionality even when dependencies aren't available

## Quick Install

For the easiest installation, simply run:

```bash
python apply_vector_db_fix.py
```

This script will automatically apply the fix to all main application files in your installation.

## Manual Installation

To apply the fix to your VaultMIND installation manually, add the following line to the top of your main application file (such as `genai_dashboard.py`, `genai_dashboard_secure.py`, or `main.py`):

```python
import vector_db_fix  # Apply Vector DB fix automatically
```

This will automatically create the necessary files and initialize the vector database provider with fallback capabilities.

## Components

The fix consists of the following components:

1. `vector_db_fix.py`: Main fix module that creates necessary files and initializes the provider
2. `utils/mock_vector_db_provider.py`: Mock vector database provider that works without dependencies
3. `utils/vector_db_init.py`: Centralized initialization system with fallback capabilities

## Testing

You can test the fix by running:

```
python test_vector_db_fix.py
```

## Real Vector Database Usage

To use the real vector database provider instead of the mock provider, install the required dependencies:

```
pip install faiss-cpu sentence-transformers
```

The system will automatically use the real provider if the dependencies are available.

## Fallback Behavior

When the real vector database is not available, the system will:

1. Fall back to the mock provider
2. Display "Ready" status with "Mock Vector DB Available (Fallback Mode)" message
3. Return simulated search results that indicate the system is in fallback mode

## Technical Details

The mock provider implements the same interface as the real provider, including:

- `search()`: Search for documents similar to a query
- `search_index()`: Search a specific index
- `get_vector_db_status()`: Get the status of the vector database
- `get_available_indexes()`: Get list of available indexes

This ensures that all code that interacts with the vector database will continue to work, even when the real database is not available.

## Components
