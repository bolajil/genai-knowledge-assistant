minimum benefits, such provision will be deemed to be amended to conform or comply 
with such laws or regulations. Notwithstanding any provision in Your Contract to the 
contrary, all distributions under Your Contract must be made in accordance with the 
applicable requirements of Section 72(s) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or

underpayments made by Us will be immediately paid in one sum with interest 
compounded at the rate of 3.00% per year. Any overpayments made by Us will be 
charged against the next succeeding annuity payment or payments with interest

alive, in the case of single ownership, if the Owner who is a natural person dies, the 
contingent owner named in the application, if any, will become the Owner. If there is no 
contingent owner named, ownership will pass to the estate of the Owner.
Subject to the Death Provisions section, during the time when at least one Annuitant
 is 
alive, in the case of multiple Owners, on the death of any Owner(s), ownership will pass to 
the surviving Owner(s). On the death of the last surviving Owner, if no contingent owner 
has been named, ownership will pass to the estate of the last surviving Owner; but if a 
contingent owner is named, ownership will pass to the contingent owner.

IV. PREMIUM AND ACCUMULATED VALUE
 Payment of Premium
The Premium is the amount We receive for Your Contract, as shown on the Contract 
Data Page, and is due on the Contract Date. Premium must be delivered to Our 
Administrative Office by You or through Your insurance producer. The minimum amount 
of Premium that will be accepted for your Contract is $5,000. The maximum amount of 
Premium that will be accepted for Your Contract is $1,000,000 and no Premium will be 
accepted after the Contract Date.
 Premium Bonus
We will calculate a Premium Bonus on the Contract Date.

on the Contract Data Page. The Premium Bonus attributable to the Premium will be 
credited to the Strategies on the Contract Date based on the Strategy Allocation 
Percentages selected by You. The Premium Bonus is only calculated and credited this 
one time.
 Accumulated Value
The Accumulated Value of Your Contract at any time is equal to the sum of the Premium 
Accumulated Value and the Premium Bonus Accumulated Value. The Accumulated Value 
is also equal to the sum of the Strategy Values.
 Premium Accumulated Value
The Premium Accumulated Value of Your Contract at any time is equal to A x [1 / (1+B)]
where:
A is the Accumulated Value; and
B is the Premium Bonus Percentage.
The Premium Accumulated Value is separate from and does not include the Premium
Bonus Accumulated Value.
 Premium Bonus Accumulated Value
The Premium Bonus Accumulated Value of Your Contract at any time is equal to the 
Accumulated Value minus the Premium Accumulated Value. The Premium Bonus 
Accumulated Value is separate from and does not include the Premium Accumulated 
Value.
 Strategy Value
The Strategy Value of a Strategy at any time is determined based on the provisions of 
the Endorsement for that Strategy.

 Strategies
The Strategies for Your Contract are the Strategies that are added to and made part of 
Your Contract by separate Endorsement. The Strategies on the Contract Date are shown 
on the Contract Data Page. After a Strategy has been added to and made part of Your 
Contract, Premium may be allocated and funds transferred to the Strategy in accordance 
with the provisions of the Endorsement for that Strategy.
 Strategy Allocation Percentages
On the Contract Date, the Premium and the Premium Bonus will be credited to the 
Strategies based on the Strategy Allocation Percentages selected by the Owner(s). The 
Strategy Allocation Percentages selected for each Strategy must be a whole percentage 
ranging from 0% to 100% and must not exceed the Maximum Allocation Percentage Limit 
for a particular Strategy. The Maximum Allocation Percentage Limit is shown on the 
Strategy Endorsement Data Page. The sum of the Strategy Allocation Percentages must 
at all times equal 100%. The Strategy Allocation Percentages in effect on the Contract 
Date are shown on the Contract Data Page.
 Transferred Premium
To the extent a Strategy allows for transfers to be made from that Strategy to one or 
more of Your Contract's other Strategies, the Transferred Premium section of the 
Endorsement for that Strategy contains the provisions for making such transfers. For any 
transfer request We receive where the amount to be transferred representsa 
percentage of a known or unknown value, We will use Our best efforts to determine the 
amount that must be transferred from each Strategy in order to satisfy the intent of Your 
original request.

VI. DEATH PROVISIONS
 Distributions on Death of an Owner who is not an Annuitant prior to the
Annuity Date
If any Owner who is not an Annuitant dies prior to the Annuity Date and a DeathBenefit 
is not payable, We will pay the Death Proceeds to the Designated Beneficiary.
We will pay the Death Proceeds within five (5) years of the death of the Owner. If the 
Designated Beneficiary is an individual, such Designated Beneficiary may elect for the 
Death Proceeds to be distributed over the life of the Designated Beneficiary, or over a 
period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Designated Beneficiary, provided 
that such distributions begin no later than one year after the Owner's death.
If the Designated Beneficiary is the deceased Owner's surviving spouse, the surviving 
spouse can elect to continue the Contract as the sole Owner in lieu of receiving the 
Death Proceeds. This provision relating to the surviving spouse can only apply once, 
and cannot apply a second time if the surviving spouse elects to continue the Contract, 
remarries and then dies.
All elections must be made by submitting the appropriate paperwork to Us.
Designated Beneficiary means: (i) the surviving Owner(s); or (ii) if there is no surviving 
Owner(s), the contingent owner named in the application, or as later changed, if any; or 
(iii) if no contingent owner is named, and there is no surviving Owner(s), the estate of
the last surviving Owner.
The Death Proceeds will be equal to the greater of the: (i) Accumulated Value, or (ii) the 
Minimum Guaranteed Contract Value.
 Death Benefit
The Death Benefit will be equal to the greater(est) of the: (i) Accumulated Value, or (ii)

death at Our Administrative Office in a form and manner satisfactory to Us,which 
includes:

• Our claim form properly completed from each Beneficiary, as applicable; and
• any other documents required by law.

 Beneficiary
The following rules apply unless otherwise permitted by Us in accordance with 
applicable law:
• No Beneficiary has any rights in Your Contract until the Beneficiary is entitled
to the Death Benefit. If the Beneficiary, including an irrevocable Beneficiary,
dies before that time, all rights of that Beneficiary will end at their death.
• If no Beneficiary has been named or if no Beneficiary is alive when the
Annuitant dies, then the Beneficiary is the estate of the first Annuitant to die,
or in the case where all Owners are natural persons and such Owners are not
Annuitants, the estate of the last Annuitant to die will be the Beneficiary. If the
death of both Joint Annuitants occurs simultaneously, the estates of bothwill
be the Beneficiary. This provision does not apply if there is a named
Beneficiary and such Beneficiary is an entity.
• If You have not designated how the Death Benefit is to be distributed and two
or more Beneficiaries are entitled to the Death Benefit, the surviving
Beneficiaries and any Beneficiaries that are entities will share the Death
Benefit equally.
• If You have designated how the Death Benefit is to be distributed and a
Beneficiary dies prior to the time such Beneficiary is entitled to the Death
Benefit, the portion of the Death Benefit designated to the deceased
Beneficiary will be divided among the surviving Beneficiaries and
Beneficiaries that are entities on a pro rata basis. In other words, each
surviving Beneficiary's or each entity Beneficiary's interest in the Death
Benefit will be divided by the sum of the interests of all such Beneficiariest o
determine the percentage each Beneficiary will receive of the deceased
Beneficiary's original interest in the Death Benefit.

FIXED STRATEGY ENDORSEMENT 
 
General Endorsement Provisions 
This Endorsement 
This endorsement is part of Your Contract and is subject to all terms, conditions, and provisions 
contained in Your Contract. Any capitalized terms not defined in this endorsement are defined in 
Your Contract. To the extent there are any conflicts between the provisions of this endorsement and 
the provisions of Your Contract, the provisions of this endorsement will control. The effective date of 
this endorsement for new Contracts is the Contract Date and for existing Contracts is the date We 
issue this endorsement. 
Fixed Strategy 
This endorsement establishes a Fixed Strategy for Your Contract.  On the effective date of this 
endorsement, You may allocate a percentage, up to the Maximum Allocation Percentage Limit, 
shown on the Fixed Strategy Schedule, of Your Accumulated Value to the Fixed Strategy. 
Strategy Value 
Strategy Value 
The Strategy Value for this Fixed Strategy at any time is equal to A + B + C + D – E – F – G, where: 
A is any Premium allocated to the Fixed Strategy; 
B is any applicable Premium Bonus credited to the Fixed Strategy; 
C is any amount(s) transferred from Your Contract’s other Strategies to the Fixed Strategy; 
D is the amount of Interest Credits that are credited to the Fixed Strategy; 
E is any amount(s) transferred from the Fixed Strategy to Your Contract’s other Strategies;  
F is Withdrawals of any type deducted from the Fixed Strategy; and 
G is any applicable charges deducted from the Fixed Strategy. 
This Fixed Strategy Value may be reduced by any Premium Taxes if provided for in the Premium 
Taxes section of Your Contract. 
Interest Credits 
We will declar e Initial and Renewal Interest Rates that will determine the interest credited to this 
Fixed Strategy. An Initial Interest Rate, which will be guaranteed for the first Contract Year only, will 
be credited to any portion of the Premium and any applicable Premium Bonus that is allocated to the 
Fixed Strategy on the Contract Date. The Initial Interest Rate is equal to the interest rate declared 
and currently in effect on the Contract Date. The Initial Interest Rate for this Fixed Strategy is shown 
on the Fixed Strategy Schedule. 
At the end of the first Contract Year and any subsequent Contract Year, We will declare a Renewal 
Interest Rate that will determine the interest credited to this Fixed Strategy. The Renewal Inter est 
Rate will be guaranteed for one Contract Year only and is guaranteed to never be less than the 
Minimum Renewal Interest Rate shown on the Fixed Strategy Schedule.

MPFIX (11/19) Page 2  MPFIX (11/19) 
Interest Credits for this Fixed Strategy are credited daily in accordance with the declared Initial 
Interest Rate or declared Renewal Interest Rate. 
Minimum Guaranteed Strategy Value 
The Minimum Guaranteed Strategy Value (“MGSV”) of this Fixed Strategy at any time is equal to A 
+ B – C – D – E, each accumulated at the applicable Minimum Guaranteed Strategy Value Interest 
Rate shown on the Fixed Strategy Schedule, where: 
A is 87.5% of the Premium credited to the Fixed Strategy on the Contract Date; 
B is the MGSV associated with any Transferred Premium that is transferred from Your 
Contract’s other Strategies to this Fixed Strategy; 
C is the MGSV associated with any Net Withdrawals from Your Contract that are deducted from 
the Fixed Strategy; 
D is the MGSV associated with any Transferred Premium that is transferred  from the Fixed 
Strategy to any of Your Contract’s other Strategies; and 
E is any Excess Amount deducted from the MGSV of the Fixed Strategy as described below in 
this section when a Net Withdrawal from Your Contract exceeds the MGSV of the Strategy 
from which the Withdrawal is taken. 
The MGSV associated with any Transferred Premium tra nsferred from a Fixed Strategy will be 
proportional to the percentage of the total Strategy Value being transferred from the Fixed Strategy. 
The MGSV associated with any Transferred Premium transferred to a Fixed Strategy will be 
proportional to the ratio of that Transferred Premium to the total Strategy Value being transferred 
from all Strategies.  
A “Net Withdrawal,” as referred to in this section, is equal to the amount of the Withdrawal, adjusted 
for any applicable Withdrawal Charge, Premium Bonus Vesting Adjustment and Market Value 
Adjustment. An “Excess Amount” is the amount of a Net Withdrawal exceeding the MGSV of the 
Strategy from which the Withdrawal is taken . Excess Amounts will be deducted from the MGSV of 
one or more of Your Contract’s other Strategies starting with the Strategy that has the lowest interest 
rate used to calculate the MGSV and ending with the Strategy that has the highest interest rate used 
to calculate the MGSV. 
Transferred Premium 
At a Contract Anniversary, You may elect to transfer some or all of the value of Your Contract among 
Your available Strategies, subject to any transfer limitations specified in this or other Strategy 
Endorsements. The amount transferred is referred to as “Transferred Premium.” To elect a transfer 
to or from this Fixed Strategy, You must Notify Us within 15 days after the Contract Anniversary on 
which the transfer shall take effect. In addition, You may only make one election under this section 
per Contract Anniversary. Your Notice must specify the Strategies to which each transfer is to be 
made. You must also specify the amount that is to be transferred, either as a total dollar amount or 
as a whole percentage of the Strategy Value.  
Withdrawals 
Unless You Notify and direct Us otherwise, all Withdrawals will be taken first from this Fixed Strategy. 
If there are not enough funds in this Fixed Strategy to cover the entire Withdrawal, We will deduct 
the balance pro rata from the other Strategies in which You have funds.

For event (1) immediately above, the Rider Char ge deducted on the Contract Anniversary is 
calculated as A x B, where: 
A  is the Annual Rid er Charge Rate; and 
B  is the Accumulated Value on that day, im mediately before any interest is credited. 
For event (1) immediately above, the Rider Charge will be deducted from the Fixed Strategy 
first, then pro-rata from each Index Strategy that  will be eligible for transfer at the end of the 
current Contract Year, and then pro-rata from any remaining Index Strategies. Strategy Values 
are eligible for transfer on each Contract Anniversary that corresponds with an Index Term End 
Date for that Strategy. 
For event (2) immediately above, the Rider Charge  deducted at the time of a Withdrawal is 
calculated as A x B x C, where: 
A  is the Annual Rid er Charge Rate;  
B  is the gross Withdrawal amount; and 
C is the amount of time since the previous Contract Anniversary. 
For event (2) immediately above, the Rider Ch arge will be deducted pro-rata from each

Strategy(ies) to cover the entire Rider Charge, We will deduct the balance pro-rata from the 
other Strategy(ies) in which You have funds. 
For event (3) immediately above, the Rider Charge at the Annuity Date is calculated as A x B x 
C, where: 
A is the Annual Rid er Charge Rate;  
B  is the Accumulated Valu e on the Annuity Date; and 
C is the amount of time since the previous Contract Anniversary. 
For events (4) and (5) immediat ely above, the Rider Charge at the surrender or termination 
date is calculated as A x B x C, where: 
A is the Annual Rid er Charge Rate;  
B  is the Accumulated Value on the surrender or termination date; and 
C is the amount of time since the previous Contract Anniversary. 
For event (6) immediately above, the Rider Charge at the date of proof of death is calculated 
as A x B x C, where: 
A is the Annual Rid er Charge Rate;  
B  is the Accumulated Value on the date We receive proof of death; and 
C is the amount of time since the previous Contract Anniversary. 
For events (3), (4), (5), and (6) immediately above, the Rider Charge will be deducted pro-rata 
from each Strategy in which You have funds.

Premium Bonus Vesting Adjustments, or Market  Value Adjustments apply to this Enhanced 
Free Withdrawal amount. The Enhanced Free Withdr awal provided by this Rider is in lieu of, 
and is not in addition to, the Free Withdrawal amount provided by Your base annuity contract.

to A x B, where: 
A  is the Enhanced Free Withdrawal Percentage; and  
B  is the Accumulated Value as of the Cont ract Anniversary on the first day of that 
Contract Year. 
The Enhanced Free Withdrawal Waiting Period  and Enhanced Free Withdrawal Percentage 
are shown on the Rider Data Page and are guaranteed not to change.

carried over to the following Contract Year. If a Withdrawal of any type was taken in the 
previous Contract Year, the Enhanced Free With drawal amount is equal to zero. Any required

ATHENE ANNUITY AND LIFE COMPANY 
INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITY ENDORSEMENT 
 
This Endorsement is added to, and is made a part of the annuity contract to which it is attached.  The contract 
to which this Endorsement is attach ed is issued as an in dividual retirement annuity  (“IRA”) under section 
408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”).  
 
If this is an inherited IRA within the meaning of Code  section 408(d)(3)(C) mainta ined for the benefit of a 
designated beneficiary of a deceased individual, or is maintained for the benefit of a designated beneficiary 
who is the surviving spouse of a deceased individual and who has not elected to treat this IRA as the surviving 
spouse’s own IRA, references in this Endorsement to the “Owner” are to the deceased individual. 
 
I. Owner and Annuitant  
 Except as otherwise permitted unde r federal law and this Endorsement, the Annuitant must be an 
individual who is the sole Owner, and neither the Owner nor the Annuitant can be changed.  If this is 
an inherited IRA within the mean ing of Code section 408(d)(3)(C) maintained for th e benefit of a 
designated beneficiary of a deceased individual, (1) the designated beneficiary must be the Annuitant, 
and (2) to the extent permitted under federal tax law, a trust maintained for the benefit of one or more 
designated beneficiaries of the Owner shall be treated in the same manner as a designated beneficiary. 
 
II. Nontransferable and nonforfeitable  
 The contract is established for th e exclusive benefit of the Owner and his or her beneficiaries.  Except 
as provided by law, the contract is  nontransferable, and the interest  of the Owner is  nonforfeitable.  
The contract may not be sold, assigned, discounted or  pledged as collateral for a loan or as security 
for the performance of any obligation or for any other purpose, to any person other than the Company 
(other than a transfer incident to a divorce or se paration instrument in accordance with Code section 
408(d)(6)). 
 
III. Contributions  
A. Single premium contract or flexible premium contract  
 The contract may permit only a single premium contribution, or it may permit flexible premium 
contributions.  The terms of the contract to which this Endorsement is attached will control 
regarding whether a single premium or flexible premiums are permitted.  If the contract permits 
only a single premium, only one contribution will be accepted.  If the contract permits flexible 
premiums, multiple contributions will be accepted. 
 
 The contract does not require fixed contributions. 
 
B. Contribution limit  
1. Unless otherwise permitted under the contr act and provided by appl icable federal tax 
law, no contribution will be accepted unless it is in cash or is: 
 
a. A rollover contribution (as permitted by C ode sections 402(c), 402(e)(6), 403(a)(4), 
403(b)(8), 403(b)(10), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16));

b. A nontaxable transfer from another indivi dual retirement plan under Code section 
7701(a)(37); or  
 
c. in the case of a contract that permits flexible premiums, a contribution made in 
accordance with a Simplified Employee Pens ion as described in Code section 
408(k). 
 
 The total cash contributions for any taxable year must not exceed the limit under Code 
sections 219(b) and 408(b) (or such other amount provided by applicable federal tax 
law). Unless otherwise provided by app licable federal tax law, the annual cash 
contribution limit is equal to $5,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2008 and years 
thereafter.  After 2008, the annual cash cont ribution limit will be  adjusted by the 
Secretary of the Treasury for cost-of-living increases under Code section 219(b)(5)(C).  
Such adjustment will be in multiples of $500. 
 
2. In the case of an Owner who is age 50 or older, the annual cash contribution limit is 
increased by $1,000 for any taxable year beginning in 2006 and years thereafter. 
 
3. In addition to the amounts described in section III.B.1 and II I.B.2 above, the Owner 
may make additional contributions (if permitted under the contract) that are specifically 
authorized by statute, such as repayments of qualified reservist distributions, certain 
plan distributions made on acc ount of a federally declared disaster, qualified birth or 
adoption distributions, and coronavirus-related distributions. 
 
C. SIMPLE IRA Plan contributions  
 No contributions will be accepted under a SIMPLE IRA Plan established by any employer 
pursuant to Code section 408(p).  Also, no tran sfer or rollover of f unds attributable to 
contributions made by a particular employer under its SIMPLE IRA Plan will be accepted from 
a SIMPLE IRA, that is, an IRA used in conjunction with a SIMPLE IRA Plan, prior to the 
expiration of the 2-year  period beginning on the date the Own er first participated in that 
employer’s SIMPLE IRA Plan. 
 
D. Inherited IRA  
 If this is an inherited IRA within the meaning of Code section 408(d)(3)(C), no contribution 
will be accepted other than a contribution that is in the form of a direct rollover from an eligible 
retirement plan of a deceased individual that  is permitted under Code section 402(c)(11), 
and/or a nontaxable transfer fro m an individual retirement plan  (as defined in Code section 
7701(a)(37) of a deceased individual.  If this IRA is maintained for the benefit of a designated 
beneficiary who is the surviving spouse of a deceased individual, and the surviving spouse 
beneficiary does not elect to treat this IRA as his or her own, the surviving spouse beneficiary 
will make no contribution other than a contribution that is in the form of a nontaxable rollover 
by the surviving spouse beneficiary from an eligible retirement plan of the deceased individual, 
or a nontaxable rollover or tr ansfer by the surviving spouse beneficiary from an individual 
retirement plan under Code section 7701(a)(37) of the deceased individual.

IV. Required distribut ions before death 
 
A. Notwithstanding any provision of  the contract to the contrary, the distribution of the Owner’s 
interest in the contract will be made in acco rdance with the requirements of Code sections 
408(b)(3) and 401(a)(9) and the Income Tax Regulations thereunder, the provisions of which 
are herein incorporated by reference.  To the extent provided in Code section 401(a)(9)(I), the 
requirements of Code section 401(a)(9) do not apply for calendar year 2020. 
 
B. Unless otherwise permitted under applicable fede ral tax law, while the Owner for whose 
benefit the contract is maintained is alive, the Owner’s entire interest in the contract will begin 
to be distributed no later than the required beginning date over (1) the Owner’s life or the lives 
of the Owner and his or her designated bene ficiary, or (2) a period not extending beyond the 
life expectancy of the Owner or the joint and last survivor expectancy of the Owner and his or 
her designated beneficiary.   
 
C. Prior to the date that dist ributions under the contract comm ence in the fo rm of annuity 
payments, the amount to be distributed for each calendar year, begi nning with the calendar 
year in which the Owner attains age 72 (or age 70½ if the Owner was born on or before June 
30, 1949) and continuing through the calendar year of death, will not be less than the quotient 
obtained by dividing the entire inte rest in the contract as of the end of the preceding year by 
the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the 
Income Tax Regulations, using the Owner’s age  as of his or her birthday in the year.  However, 
if the Owner’s sole designated beneficiary is his or her surv iving spouse and such spouse is 
more than 10 years younger than the Owner, then the distribution period is determined under 
the Joint and Last Survivor Table in Q&A-3 of section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the ages as of the 
Owner’s and spouse’s birthdays in the year. 
 
D. If distributions are made in th e form of annuity payments, the distribution periods described in 
section IV.B above cannot exceed the periods specified in section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Income 
Tax Regulations and the annuity payments must otherwise comply with the requirements of 
that section.  (See section VI.D below for other special rules for annuity payments.) 
 
E. The Owner may take a required minimum distributi on with respect to this contract (other than 
a distribution made under this contract in the form of an  annuity payment) from any one or 
more IRAs that the Owner holds as the owner. 
 
F. If this IRA is issued to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary of a deceased employee 
or individual under an eligible retirement plan (as defined C ode section 402(c)(8)(B)), this 
section IV does not apply unless (1) such designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the 
deceased employee or individual, and (2) for federal income tax purposes such spouse is treated 
as the owner of this IRA, rath er than as the designated beneficiary of the deceased employee 
or individual.

V. Required distributions after death 
 
A. If the Owner dies before the distribution of the Owner’s entire interest and the beneficiary 
is a designated beneficiary: 
 
1. In general.  Subject to the exception for an  eligible designated beneficiary in section 
V.A.2, the entire interest will be distributed in accordance with applicable federal 
tax law by the end of the calendar year containing the tenth anniversary of the 
Owner’s death. 
 
2. Exception for eligible designated beneficiaries.  If any portion of the Owner’s 
interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) an eligible designated beneficiary, such 
portion will be distributed in accordance with applicable federal tax law: 
 
a. over the life of such eligible desi gnated beneficiary, or over a period not 
extending beyond the life expectancy of such eligible designated 
beneficiary, starting no later than the end of the calendar year following the 
calendar year of the Owner’s death (or the end of the calendar year in which 
the Owner would have attained age 72 (or age 70½ if the Owner was born 
on or before June 30, 1949), if later a nd the sole designated beneficiary is 
the surviving spouse of the Owner), or 
 
b. if elected, by the end of the calenda r year containing the tenth anniversary 
of the Owner’s death. 
 
3. Rules upon death of an eligib le designated beneficiary. 
 
a. If an eligible designated beneficiar y dies before the portion of the Owner’s 
interest to which this section V.A applies is entirely distributed, the 
exception under section V.A.2.a will not apply to any beneficiary of such 
eligible designated beneficiary and th e remainder of such  portion will be 
distributed within 10 years after the death of such eligible designated 
beneficiary. 
 
b. If the eligible designated  beneficiary is the surv iving spouse of the Owner 
and the surviving spouse dies before  distributions to such spouse under 
section V.A.2.a begin, this section V. A will be applied as if the surviving 
spouse were the Owner. 
 
For this purpose, distributions are considered to commence on the date distributions 
are required to begin to the surviving spouse under sect ion V.A.2.a.  However, if 
distributions start prior to the applicable  date in the preceding sentence, on an 
irrevocable basis (except for acceleration) in the form of annuity payments meeting 
the requirements of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Income Tax Regulations, then 
required distributions are considered to commence on the annuity starting date.

4. After annuity payments commence to the Owner or a beneficiary, annuity payments 
may need to be modified as necessary to comply with this section V.A. 
 
B. Application of section V.A.  Except as ot herwise provided under ap plicable federal tax 
law:  
 
1. section V.A applies to distributions w ith respect to an Owner who dies after 
December 31, 2019, and 
 
2. if the Owner dies before January 1, 2020, and such Owner’s designated beneficiary 
dies after such date, the entire remaining interest in the contract will be distributed 
by the end of the calendar year containing the tenth anniversary of such designated 
beneficiary’s death. 
 
C. If the Owner dies before the distribution of the Owner’s entire interest and the beneficiary 
is not a designated beneficiary, unless otherwise provided under applicable federal tax law, 
the remaining interest will be distributed as follows: 
 
1. If the Owner dies on or after the required  beginning date (or dies on or after the 
date annuity payments comme nce if distributions comme nce prior to the required 
beginning date in the form of annuity paym ents in accordance with the provisions 
of Q&A-1 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Income Tax Regulations), the remaining 
interest will be distribu ted in accordance with Code  section 401(a)(9) and the 
Income Tax Regulations thereunder at le ast as rapidly as under the method of 
distributions being used as of the date of the Owner’s death.  
 
2. If the Owner dies prior to the required beginning date (and prior to the date annuity 
payments commence) the remaining interest  will be distributed by the end of the 
calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Owner’s death. 
 
D. Life expectancy is determined using the Single Life Table in Q&A-1 of section 
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Income Tax Regulations.  If distributions are being made to a surviving 
spouse as the sole designated beneficiary, su ch spouse’s remaining life expectancy for a 
calendar year is the number in the Single Life Table corresponding to such spouse’s age in 
the year.  In all other cases, remaining life expectancy for a calendar year is the number in 
the Single Life Table corresponding to the beneficiary’s age as of his or her birthday in the 
calendar year following the calendar year of the Owner’s death and reduced by 1 for each 
subsequent year.  If distributi ons are being made in the fo rm of annuity payments, life 
expectancy will not be recalculated. 
 
E. The required minimum distributions payable to a designated bene ficiary from this IRA 
(other than a distribution made  under this contract in the form of annuity payments) may 
be withdrawn from another IRA the benefi ciary holds from the same decedent in 
accordance with Q&A-9 of section 1.408-8 of the Income Tax Regulations.

F. The surviving spouse of the Owner who is the sole beneficiary and has an unlimited right 
to withdraw amounts may elect to treat this contract as the spouse’s own IRA.  This election 
can be made by redesignating the contract in the name of the surviving spouse as the owner 
rather than as beneficiary.  Alternatively, the surviving spouse who is eligible to make the 
election is deemed to have made the election if, at any time, such surviving spouse makes 
a contribution to the IRA or fails to take required distributions as a beneficiary.   
 
VI. Definitions a nd special rules 
 
A.  Required beginning date.  The term “require d beginning date” means the first day of April

d.  a chronically ill individual (wit hin the meaning of Code section 
7702B(c)(2), except that the requirements of Code section 
7702B(c)(2)(A)(i) will be treated as met only if there is a certification that, 
as of such date, the period of in ability described in Code section

is reasonably expected to be lengthy in nature), or 
 
e.  an individual not described in any of the preceding clauses of this section 
VI.C.1 who is not more than 10 years younger than the Owner.

Owner’s interest to which section V.A.2.a applies will be distributed within 10 
years after such date. 
 
D. Special rules for annuity pa yments.  The options under which annuity payments are made 
may be limited.  Unless otherwise provided under applicable federal tax law: 
 
1. Distributions in the form of annuity payments must satisfy the applicable 
requirements of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of  the Income Tax Regulations, the 
provisions of which are herein incorporated by reference. 
 
2. Distributions made in the form of annuity payments must be made in periodic 
payments and the interval between payments for the annuity must be uniform over 
the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year. 
 
3.  Annuity payments must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit 
requirements in Q&A-2 of section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Income Tax Regulations. 
 
4. Annuity payments must be nonincreasing or increase only as permitted by Q&A-

5. If distributions (including distributions commencing on or before the required

the first annuity payment must be the pa yment which is required for one payment 
interval.  The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment 
interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year.  Similarly, in 
the case of distributions commencing afte r death in accordance with Code section 
401(a)(9)(B)(iii) and (iv), the first payment, which must be made on or before the 
date determined under A-3(a) or (b) (w hichever is applicable) of section 
1.401(a)(9)-3 of the Income Tax Regulatio ns, must be the payment which is 
required for one payment interval. Paymen t intervals are the periods for which 
payments are received, e.g., bimonthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. 
 
6. If annuity payments commence after the date distributions are required to 
commence (the required be ginning date in the case of  distributions commencing 
before death, or the date  determined under Q&A-3 of section 1.401(a)(9)-3 of the 
Income Tax Regulations in the case of distributions commencing after death), 
distributions must be made in accordance with Q&A-1(e) of section 1.401(a)(9)-5 
of the Income Tax Regulations. 
 
7.  Prior to the date annuity payments comme nce, the “entire interest” under an annuity 
contract is the dollar amount credited to the Owner or beneficiary under the contract 
plus the actuarial present value of any additional benefits (such as survivor benefits 
in excess of the dollar amount credited to the Owner or beneficiary) that will be 
provided under the contract.

What is an Annuity?  
An annuity is a contract in which an insurance company makes a series 
of income payments at regular intervals in return for a premium  o r

financial goals. 
 
Your value in an annuity contract is the premiums you’ve paid, less any 
applicable charges, plus interest credited. The insurance compa ny uses

A deferred annuity has two parts or periods. During the accumul ation period, the money you 
put into the annuity, less any applicable charges, earns interest. The earnings grow tax-deferred 
as long as you leave them in the a n n u i t y .  During  the second period, called the payout period, 
the company pays income to you or to someone you choose.

spells out your payments and how often you’ll make them.  
 
Immediate or Deferred  
 
With an immediate annuity, income payments start no later than o n e  y e a r  a f t e r  y o u  p a y  t h e 
premium. You usually pay for an immediate annuity with one paym ent. The income payments 
from a deferred annuity often start many years later . Deferred annuities have an accumulation 
period, which is the time between when you start paying premium s and when income 
payments start.

What Are Some Fixed Deferred Annuity Contract 
Benefits? 
Annuity Income Payments  
 
One of the most important benefits of deferred annuities is you r  a bi l i t y t o u s e th e  v a l u e b ui l t

payments during the payout period. Income payments are usually made monthly but you may 
choose to receive them less often. The size of income payments is based on the accumulated  
value in your annuity and the annuity’s benefit rate in effect when income payments start. The

as your spouse lives or for a set number of years.

current rates can never be less than the guaranteed benefit rat es. When income payments 
start, the i nsurance company generally us es the benefi t rate i n effect at the ti me to fi gu r e the 
amount of your income payment.  
 
Companies may offer various income payment options. You (the ow ner) or another person 
that you name may choos e the option. The opti ons a r e des cri bed her e as i f the payments  a r e  
made to you.

you die.  This payment option usually pays the highest income p ossible.  You might choose it

dependents have enough income of their own.  
 
Life Annuity with Period Certain
 
The company pays income for as long as you live and guarantees to make payments for a s et 
number of years even if you die. This period certain is usually  10 or 20 years. If you live longer 
than the period certain, you’ll continue to receive payments un til you die.  If you die during  
the period certain, your beneficiary gets regular payments for the rest of that period. If you  
die after the period certain, your beneficiary doesn’t receive any payments from your annuity.

an annuity may use one value for long-term care benefits and a different value if the annuity is  
surrendered.  You can’t receive more than one benefit at the sa me time. 
 
What About the T ax T reatment of Annuities? 
Below is a general discussion about taxes and annuities. You  
should consult a professional tax advisor to discuss your  
individual tax situation. 
 
Under current federal law, annuities receive special tax  
treatment. Income tax on annuities is deferred, which means 
y o u  a r e n ’ t  t a x e d  o n  t h e  i n t e r e s t  y o u r  m o n e y  e a r n s  w h i l e  i t 
s t a y s  i n  t h e  a n n u i t y .  T a x - d e f e r r e d  a c c u m u l a t i o n  i s n ’ t  t h e  
same as tax-free accumulation. An advantage of tax deferral  
i s  t h a t  t h e  t a x  b r a c k e t  y o u ’ r e  i n  w h e n  y o u  r e c e i v e  a n n u i t y 
income payments may be lower than the one you’re in during 
the accumulation period. You’ll also be earning interest on the  amount you would have paid in  
taxes during the accumulation period. Most states’ tax laws on annuities follow the federal law. 
 
Part of the payments you receive from annuity will be considere d  as a r etu rn  of  the p r emi um 
y o u ’ v e  p a i d .  Y o u  w o n ’ t  h a v e  t o  p a y  t a x e s  o n  t h a t  p a r t .  A n o t h e r  part of the payments is 
c o n s i d e r e d  i n t e r e s t  you ’ v e e a rn e d .  Y o u  mu s t  p a y  t ax e s  o n  th e part that is considered interest 
when you withdraw the money. You may also have to pay a 10% tax penalty if you withdraw the 
accumulation before age 59½. The Internal Revenue Code also has  rules about distributions  
after the death of a contract holder. 
 
Annuities used to fund certain employee pension benefit plans ( those under Internal Revenue  
Code Sections 401(a), 401(k), 403(b), 457 or 414) defer taxes on plan contributions as well as on 
i n t e r e s t  o r  i n v e s t m e n t  i n c o m e .  W i t h i n  t h e  l i m i t s  s e t  b y  t h e l a w, you can use pretax dollars to 
make payments to the annuity.  When you take money out, it will be taxed.

How Do I Know if a Fixed Deferred Annuity Is Right for  
Me? 
The questions listed below may help you decide which type of an nuity, if any, meets your  
retirement planning and financial needs. You should think about  w h a t  y o u r  g o a l s  a r e  f o r  t h e 
m o n e y  y o u  m a y  p u t  i n t o  t h e  a n n u i t y .  Y o u  n e e d  t o  t h i n k  a b o u t  h o w much risk you’re willing to  
take with the money.  Ask yourself:  
 
Ȉ How much retirement income will I need in addition to what I wi ll get from Social Security  
and my pension? 
Ȉ Will I need that additional income only for myself or for mysel f and someone else?  
Ȉ How long can I leave my money in the annuity?  
Ȉ When will I need income payments? 
Ȉ Does the annuity let me get money when I need it?  
Ȉ Do I want a fixed annuity with a guaranteed interest rate and l ittle or no risk of losing the  
principal? 
Ȉ Do I want a variable annuity with the potential for higher earn ings that aren’t guaranteed 
and the possibility that I may risk losing principal?  
Ȉ Or, am I somewhere in between and willing to take some risks wi th an equity-indexed 
annuity? 
 
What Questions Should I Ask My Agent or the Company?  
Ȉ Is this a single premium or multiple premium contract?  
Ȉ Is this an equity-indexed annuity? 
Ȉ What is the initial interest rate and how long is it  
guaranteed? 
Ȉ Does the initial rate include a bonus rate and how  
much is the bonus?  
Ȉ What is the guaranteed minimum interest rate? 
Ȉ What renewal rate is the company crediting on annuity 
contracts of the same type that were issued last year?

Final Points to Consider 
B e f o r e  y o u  d e c i d e  t o  b u y  a n  a n n u i t y ,  y o u  s h o u l d  r e v i e w  t h e  c o n tract. Terms and conditions  
of each annuity contract will vary.  
 
A s k  y o u r s e l f  i f ,  d e p e n d i n g  o n  y o u r  n e e d s  o r  a g e ,  t h i s  a n n u i t y  is right for you. Taking money 
out of an annuity may mean you must pay taxes. Also,  while  i t ’ s  so me time s possib le  to tra n sfe r 
the value of an older annuity into a new annuity, the new annui ty may have a new schedule of  
charges that could mean new expenses you must pay directly or i ndirectly. 
 
You should understand the long-term nature of your purchase. Be  s u r e  y o u  p l a n  t o  k e e p  a n 
annuity long enough so that the charges don’t take too much of the money you put in. Be sure  
you understand the effect of all charges. 
 
If you’re  buying an annuity to fund an IRA or other tax-deferred retirement program, be sure that  
you’re eligible.   Also, ask if there are any restrictions conn ected with the program.  
 
Remember that the quality of service that you can expect from t he company and the agent is a  
very important factor in your decision. 
 
When you receive your annuity contract, READ IT CAREFULLY! Ask the agent and company for 
a n  e x p l a n a t i o n  o f  a n y t h i n g  y o u  d o n ’ t  u n d e r s t a n d .    D o  t h i s  b e f or e  a n y  f r e e  l o o k  p e r i o d  e n d s . 
 
Compare information for similar contracts from several companie s. Comparing products may  
help you make a better decision. 
 
If you have a specific question or can’t get answers you need from the agent or company, contact 
your state insurance department.

the index might be tied to a stock or other equity index.  One of the most commonly used indices  
i s  S t a n d a r d  &  P o o r ’ s  5 0 0  C o m p o s i t e  S t o c k  P r i c e  I n d e x  ( t h e  S & P  500)1, which is an equity index.

When you buy an equity-indexed annuity you own an insurance con t r a c t .  Y o u  a r e  n o t  b u y i n g

While immediate equity-indexed annuities may be available, this  appendix will focus on deferred  
equity-indexed  annuities. 
 
How Are They Different from Other Fixed Annuities?  
An equity-indexed annuity is different from other fixed annuiti es because of the way it credits  
i n t e r e s t  t o  y o u r  a n n u i t y ’ s  va l ue .   S om e  f i xe d  a n n u i t i e s  o n l y  c redit interest calculated at a rate set  
i n  t h e  c o n t r a c t .  O t h e r  f i x e d  a n n u i t i e s  a l s o  c r e d i t  i n t e r e s t  a t  rates set from time to time by the  
insurance company. Equity-indexed annuities credit interest usi n g  a  f o r m u l a  b a s e d  o n  c h a n g e s 
in the index to which the annuity is linked. The formula decide s how the additional interest, if  
a n y ,  i s  c a l c u l a t e d  a n d  c r e d i t e d .  H o w  m u c h  a d d i t i o n a l  i n t e r e s t  yo u  g e t  a n d  w h e n  y o u   g e t   i t  
d e p e n d s  o n  t h e  f e a t u r e s  o f  y o u r  p a r t i c u l a r  a n n u i t y . 
 
Your equity-indexed annuity, like other fixed annuities, also p r o m i s e s  t o  p a y  a  m i n i m u m  i n t e r e s t 
rate. The rate that will be applied will not be less than this minimum guaranteed rate even if the  
i n d e x - l i n k e d  i n t e r e s t  r a t e  i s  l o w e r .  T h e  v a l u e  o f  y o u r  a n n u i t y  also will not drop below a  
guaranteed minimum. For example, many single premium contracts  guarantee  the  minimum 
value will never be less that 90 percent of the premium paid, p l u s  a t  l e a s t  3 %  i n  a n n u a l  i n t e r e s t 
(less any partial with drawals). The guaranteed value is the min imum amount available during a  
term for withdrawals, as well as for some annuitizations (see “ Annuity Income Payments”) and  
death benefits. The insurance co mpany will adjust the value of the annuity at the end of each  
term to reflect an y index increases.

Equity-Indexed Annuities 
 
What Are Some Equity-Indexed Annuity Contract 
Features? 
Two features that have the greatest effect on the  
amount of additional interest that may be credited to an 
equity-indexed annuity are the indexing method and the  
participation rate. It is important to understand the  
f e a t u r e s  a n d  h o w  t h e y  w o r k  t o g e t h e r .  T h e  f o l l o w i n g 
describes some other equity-indexed annuity features  
that affect the index-linked formula. 
 
Indexing Method  
T h e  i n d e x i n g  m e t h o d  m e a n s  t h e  a p p r o a c h  u s e d  t o  m e a s u r e  t h e  a m o unt of change, if any, in  
the i ndex. S ome of the most common i ndexing methods, whi ch a r e explained more fully later 
on, include annual reset (ratcheting), high-water mark and poin t-to-point. 
 
Term 
The index term is the period over which index-linked interest i s calculated; the interest is  
credited to your annuity at the end of a term. Terms are genera lly from one to ten years, with  
s i x  o r  s e v e n  y e a r s  b e i n g  m o s t  c o m m o n .  S o m e  a n n u i t i e s  o f f e r  s i n gl e  t e r m s  w h i l e  o t h e r s  o f f e r 
multiple, consecutive terms. If your annuity has multiple terms , there will usually  be  a 
w i n d o w  a t  t h e  e n d  o f  e a c h  t e r m ,  t y p i c a l l y  3 0  d a y s ,  d u r i n g  w h i c h y o u  m a y  w i t h d r a w  y o u r  
money without penalty. For installment premium annuities, the p a y m e n t  o f  e a c h  p r e m i u m 
may begin a new term for that premium.  
 
Participation Rate 
The participation rate decides how much of the increase in the index will be used to  
calculated index-linked interest. For example, if the calculate d  c h a n g e  i n  t h e  i n d e x  i s  9 %  a n d  
the participation rate is 70%, the index-linked interest rate for your annuity will be 6.3% (9% x 
70 %  =  6 . 3 % ) .  A  co m p a ny m a y s e t a d i f f e r e n t  p a r ti c i p a ti on  r a t e fo r n e w l y i s s u e d a n n ui ti es a s 
often as each day.  Therefore, the initial participation rate in your annuity will depend on when  
it is issued by the company. The company usually guarantees the  p a r t i c i p a t i o n  r a t e  f o r  a  
specific period (from one year to the entire term).  When that period is over, the company sets 
a new participation rate for the next period. Some annuities gu arantee that the participation 
rate will never be set lower than a specified minimum or higher  than a specified maximum.  
 
Cap Rate or Cap 
S o m e  a n n u i t i e s  m a y  p u t  a n  u p p e r  l i m i t ,  o r  c a p ,  o n  t h e  i n d e x - l i nk e d  i n t e r e s t  r a t e .  T h i s  i s  t h e 
maximum rate of interest the annuity will earn.  In the example  given above, if the contract has  
a 6% cap rate, 6%, and not 6.3%, would be credited.  Not all an nuities have a cap rate.

Equity-Indexed Annuities 
 
Floor on Equity-Indexed Interest  
The floor is the minimum index-linked interest rate you will ea rn. The most common floor is  
0%. A 0% floor assures that even if the index decreases in valu e, the index-linked interest that 
you earn will be zero and not negative. As in the case of a cap , not all annuities have a stated  
floor on i ndex-li nked i nte res t rates . But i n all cas es , your fixed annuity will have a minimum  
guaranteed value. 
 
Averaging 
I n  so m e  an n ui ti e s,  th e  av e r a g e  of  a n i n d e x ’ s  v a lu e  i s  us e d  r a ther than the actual value of the

throughout the entire term of the annuity.  
 
Interest  Compounding 
Some annuities pay simple interest during an index term. That m eans index-linked interest is  
added to your original premium amount but does not compound dur ing the term. Others pay  
c o m p o u n d  i n t e r e s t  d u r i n g  a  t e r m ,  w h i c h  m e a n s  t h a t  i n d e x - l i n k e d  interest that has already  
been cr edi t ed als o earns i nt er es t i n the fu tu re . In ei ther cas e, however, the interest earned in  
one term is usually compounded in the next.  
 
Margin/Spread/Administrative  Fee 
I n  s o m e  a n n u i t i e s ,  t h e  i n d e x - l i n k e d  i n t e r e s t  r a t e  i s  c o m p u t e d  by subtracting a specific  
p e r c e n t a g e  f r o m  a n y  c a l c u l a t e d  c h a n g e  i n  t h e  i n d e x .  T h i s  p e r c e ntage, sometimes referred to  
as the “margin,” “spread,” or “administrative fee,” might be in s t e a d  o f ,  o r  i n  a d d i t i o n  t o ,  a  
participation rate. For example, if the calculated change in th e index is 10%, your annuity 
m i g h t  s p e c i f y  t h a t  2 . 2 5 %  w i l l  b e  s u b t r a c t e d  f r o m  t h e  r a t e  t o  d etermine the interest rate 
credited. In this example, the rate would be 7.75% (10% - 2.25% = 7.75%). In this example, the 
company subtracts the percentage only if the change in the inde x produces a positive interest  
rate. 
 
Vesting 
Some annuities credit none of the index-linked interest or only  p a r t  o f  i t ,  i f  y o u  t a k e  o u t  a l l 
yo u r mo n e y b e f o r e  th e e n d of t h e t e r m . Th e p e r c e n t a g e  t h a t i s  vested, or credited, generally 
increases as the term comes closer to its end and is always 100 % at the end of the term.

Buyer’s Guide to Fixed Deferred Annuities... 
 
Equity-Indexed Annuities 
 
How Do the Common Indexing Methods Differ?  
Annual Reset 
 
Index-linked interest, if any, is determined each year by comparing the index value at the end of  
the contract year with the index value at the start of the cont ract year. Interest is added to your  
annuity each year during the term. 
 
High-Water Mark 
 
The index-linked interest, if any, is decided by looking at the  i n d e x  v a l u e  a t  v a r i o u s  p o i n t s 
d u r i n g  t h e  t e r m ,  u s u a l l y  t h e  a n n u a l  a n n i v e r s a r i e s  o f  t h e  d a t e  you bought the annuity. The  
interest is based on the di fference between the highest index value and the index value at the  
start of the term. Interest is added to your annuity at the end  of the term.  
 
Low-Water Mark 
 
The index-linked interest, if any, is determined by looking at the index value at various points  
d u r i n g  t h e  t e r m ,  u s u a l l y  t h e  a n n u a l  a n n i v e r s a r i e s  o f  t h e  d a t e  you bought the annuity. The  
i n t e r e s t  i s  b a s e d  o n  t h e  d i f f e r e n c e  b e t w e e n  t h e  i n d e x  v a l u e  a t  the end of the term and the  
lowest index value.  Interest is added to your annuity at the e nd of the term.  
 
Point-to-Point 
 
The index-linked interest, if any, is based on the difference b etween the index value at the end 
o f  t h e  t e r m  a n d  t h e  i n d e x  v a l u e  a t  t h e  s t a r t  o f  t h e  t e r m .  I n t e re s t  i s  a d d e d  t o  y o u r  a n n u i t y  a t  
the end of the term.  
 
What Are Some of the Features  
and T rade-Offs of Different  
Indexing Methods? 
Generally, equity-indexed annuities offer preset  
combinations of features. You may have to make trade-  
offs to get features you want in an a nn ui ty. This means 
the annuity you chose may also have features you  
don’t want.

Equity-Indexed Annuities 
 
 
Featur es 
 
 
Annual Reset 
 
Since the interest earned is “locked in” annually and the index  v a l u e  i s  “ r e s e t ”  a t  t h e  e n d  o f  
e a c h  y e a r ,  f u t u r e  d e c r e a s e s  i n  t h e  i n d e x  w i l l  n o t  a f f e c t  t h e  i nt e r e s t  y o u  h a v e  a l r e a d y  e a r n e d . 
Therefore, your annuity using the annual reset method may credi t more interest than annuities 
u s i n g  o t h e r  m e t h o d s  w h e n  t h e  i n d e x  f l u c t u a t e s  u p  a n d  d o w n  o f t e n during the term. This  
design is more likely than others to give you access to index-l inked interest before the term  
ends. 
 
High-Water Mark 
 
S i n c e  i n t e r e s t  i s  c a l c u l a t e d  u s i n g  t h e  h i g h e s t  v a l u e  o f  t h e  i n dex on a contract anniversary  
during the term, this design may credit higher interest than so me other designs if the index 
reaches a high point early or in the middle of the term, then d rops off at the end of the term.  
 
Low-Water Mark 
 
Since interest is calculated using the lowest value of the inde x prior to the end of the term, this  
d e s i g n  m a y  c r e d i t  h i g h e r  i n t e r e s t  t h a n  s o m e  o t h e r  d e s i g n s  i f  t he index reaches a low point 
early or in the middle of the term and then rises at the end of  the term. 
 
Point-to-Point 
 
S i n c e  i n t e r e s t  c a n n o t  b e  c a l c u l a t e d  b e f o r e  t h e  e n d  o f  t h e  t e r m , use of this design may permit  
a higher participation rate than annuities using other designs.  
 
T rade-Offs 
 
 
Annual Reset 
 
Your annuity’s participation rate may change each year and gene r a l l y  w i l l  b e  l o w e r  t h a n  t h a t

the total amount of interest you might earn each year.  
 
High-Water Mark 
 
Interest is not credited until the end of the term. In some ann uities, if you surrender your 
a n n u i t y  b e f o r e  t h e  e n d  o f  t h e  t e r m ,  y o u  m a y  n o t  g e t  i n d e x - l i n k ed  i n t e r e s t  f o r  t h a t  t e r m .  I n 
other annuities, you may receive index-linked interest, based o n the highest anniversary value 
to date and the annuity’s vesting schedule. Also, contracts wit h this design may have a lower  
participation rate than annuities using other designs or may us e a cap to limit the total amount 
of interest you might earn.

What Is the Impact of Some  Other Equity-Indexed Annuity 
Product Features? 
Cap on Interest Earned 
 
While a cap limits the amount of interest you might earn each y ear, annuities with this feature 
may have other product features you want, such as annual intere st crediting or the ability to  
take partial withdrawals.  Also, annuities that have a cap may have a higher participation rate.

Participation Rate  
 
The participation rate may vary greatly from one annuity to ano t h e r  a n d  f r o m  t i m e  t o  t i m e 
within a particular annuity. Therefore, it is important for you  to know how your annuity’s  
participation rate works with the indexing method. A high parti cipation rate may be offset by  
other features, such as simple interest, averaging, or a point- to-point indexing method. On the  
other hand, an insurance company may offset a lower participati on rate by also offering a 
feature such as an annual reset indexing method.

Buyer’s Guide to Fixed Deferred Annuities... 
 
Equity-Indexed Annuities 
 
Interest  Compounding 
It is important for you to know whether your annuity pays compo und or simple interest during 
a term. While you may earn less from an annuity that pays simpl e interest, it may have other 
features you want, such as a higher participation rate.  
 
What Will It Cost Me to T ake My Money Out Before the  
End of the T erm? 
In addition to the information discussed in this Buyer’s Guide about surrender and withdrawal 
charges and free withdrawals, there are additional consideratio ns for equity-indexed  
annuities. Some annuities credit none of the index-linked inter est or only part of it if you take  
o u t  m o n e y  b e f o r e  t h e  e n d  o f  t h e  t e r m .  T h e  p e r c e n t a g e  t h a t  i s  v ested, or credited, generally 
increases as the term comes closer to its end and is always 100 % at the end of the term.  
 
Are Dividends Included in the Index?  
Depending on the index used, stock dividends may or may not be included in the index’s value. 
For example, the S&P 500 is a stock price index and only consid ers the prices of stocks. It does  
not recognize any dividends paid on those stocks.  
 
How Do I Know if an Equity-Indexed Annuity is Right for  
Me? 
The questions listed below may help you decide which 
type of annuity, if any, meets your retirement planning  
and financial needs. You should consider what your 
goals are for the money you may put into the annuity.  
You need to think about how much risk you’re willing  
to take with the money.  Ask yourself:  
 
Ȉ Am I interested in a variable annuity with the  
potential for higher earnings that are not 
guaranteed and willing to risk losing the principal?  
 
Ȉ Is a guaranteed interest rate more important to me, with little  or no risk of losing the  
principal? 
 
Ȉ Or, am I somewhere in between these two extremes and willing to  take some risks?

 Equity-Indexed Annuities 
 
How Do I Know Which Equity-Indexed Annuity is Best for  
Me? 
As with any other insurance product, you must carefully conside r your own personal situation 
a n d  h o w  y o u  f e e l  a b o u t  t h e  c h o i c e s  a v a i l a b l e .  N o  s i n g l e  a n n u i t y d e s i g n  m a y  h a v e   a l l   t h e

c a n  c h o o s e  t h e  a n n u i t y  t h a t  i s  r i g h t  f o r  y o u .  K e e p  i n  m i n d  t h a t it may be misleading to  
compare one annuity to another unless you compare all the other  f e a t u r e s  o f  e a c h  a n n u i t y . 
You must decide for yourself what combination of features makes  t h e  m o s t  s e n s e  f o r  y o u . 
Also remember that it is not possible to predict the future beh avior of an index.  
 
Questions Y ou Should Ask Y our Agent or the Company 
You  should  ask  the  following  questions  about  equity-indexed  annuities  in  addition  to  the 
questions in the Buyer’s Guide to Fixed Deferred Annuities.  
 
Ȉ How long is the term? 
Ȉ What is the guaranteed minimum interest rate? 
Ȉ What is the participation rate?  For how long is the participat ion rate guaranteed? 
Ȉ Is there a minimum participation rate? 
Ȉ Does my contract have an interest rate cap?  What is it?  
Ȉ Does my contract have an interest rate floor?  What is it?  
Ȉ Is interest rate averaging used?  How does it work?  
Ȉ Is interest compounded during a term?  
Ȉ Is there a margin, spread, or administrative fee?  Is that in a ddition to or instead of a 
participation rate? 
Ȉ What indexing method is used in my contract?  
Ȉ What are the surrender charges or penalties if I want to end my contract early and take out 
all of my money? 
Ȉ Can I get a partial withdrawal without paying charges or losing  interest? Does my contract 
have vesting?  If so, what is the rate of vesting?  
 
Final Points to Consider
