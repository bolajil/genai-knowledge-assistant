# VaultMind Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue Analysis

### Problem: Enterprise Authentication Changes Not Taking Effect

**Root Cause:** You're running the wrong dashboard file.

### Current Setup Issues:

1. **Wrong File Running**: `genai_dashboard_secure.py` (old monolithic version)
2. **Should Be Running**: `genai_dashboard_modular.py` (new enterprise auth system)
3. **Missing Configuration**: Default security config not initialized

## Quick Solution

### Step 1: Stop Current Dashboard
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current Streamlit session
```

### Step 2: Run Enterprise Dashboard
```bash
# Option A: Direct command
streamlit run genai_dashboard_modular.py

# Option B: Use launcher script
python run_enterprise.py
```

### Step 3: Access Enterprise Login
- Open: http://localhost:8501
- You'll see the new enterprise login page with:
  - Authentication method selection
  - Active Directory status
  - Okta SSO status  
  - MFA configuration status

## File Comparison

### OLD (Currently Running): `genai_dashboard_secure.py`
- Monolithic file (3048 lines)
- Old authentication system
- AttributeError issues with user.role.value
- No enterprise features

### NEW (Should Run): `genai_dashboard_modular.py`
- Modular design (200 lines)
- Enterprise authentication integration
- Real AD/Okta/MFA support
- Admin security setup dashboard

## Configuration Status

✅ **Created Files:**
- `config/security_config.json` - Default security configuration
- `run_enterprise.py` - Enterprise dashboard launcher
- All enterprise auth modules in `app/auth/`

✅ **Ready Features:**
- Local login (default enabled)
- Active Directory integration (ready to configure)
- Okta SSO integration (ready to configure)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (ready to configure)
- Security setup dashboard in Admin Panel

## Next Steps

1. **Switch to modular dashboard** - Run `genai_dashboard_modular.py`
2. **Login with existing credentials** - Use your current admin account
3. **Access Security Setup** - Go to Admin Panel → Security Setup tab
4. **Configure enterprise providers** - Set up AD/Okta as needed

## Expected Behavior After Switch

### Login Page Changes:
- Authentication method selector
- Provider status indicators
- Enterprise login options (when configured)

### Admin Panel Changes:
- New "Security Setup" tab alongside "User Management"
- Complete enterprise configuration interface
- Real-time connection testing

### Security Features:
- Encrypted credential storage
- Account lockout protection
- Audit logging
- Session management

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check if modular dashboard exists
ls -la genai_dashboard_modular.py

# Check enterprise auth files
ls -la app/auth/enterprise_auth_*

# Check configuration
cat config/security_config.json

# Run with debug
streamlit run genai_dashboard_modular.py --logger.level=debug
```

## Why Changes Weren't Working

The enterprise authentication system was implemented in the **modular dashboard** (`genai_dashboard_modular.py`), but you were still running the **old secure dashboard** (`genai_dashboard_secure.py`). 

The old dashboard doesn't have the new enterprise features, so no matter what changes were made to the enterprise auth system, they wouldn't appear because the wrong file was being executed.

## Success Indicators

After switching to the modular dashboard, you should see:

✅ New enterprise login interface
✅ Authentication method selection
✅ Provider status indicators  
✅ Security Setup tab in Admin Panel
✅ No more user.role.value errors
✅ Working enterprise authentication flow

**Solution: Run `streamlit run genai_dashboard_modular.py` instead of the secure dashboard.**
