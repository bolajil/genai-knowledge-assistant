## 🛠️ Demo Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No indexes found"**
```bash
# Check indexes
python check_indexes.py

# Create sample index
python scripts/create_demo_index.py
```

**"OpenAI API error"**
```bash
# Verify API key
python check_config.py

# Use fallback LLM
# Set in .env: LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
```

**"Weaviate connection failed"**
- Check `.env` has `WEAVIATE_URL` and `WEAVIATE_API_KEY`
- Fallback to FAISS: Change backend in sidebar

### Pre-Demo Checklist

- [ ] At least 2 sample documents ingested
- [ ] Test query in each tab (Query, Chat, Agent, Hybrid)
- [ ] Weaviate cloud console open (if using)
- [ ] Terminal visible for live logs
- [ ] Backup: Local FAISS indexes ready
