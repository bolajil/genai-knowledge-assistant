# VaultMind GenAI Knowledge Assistant

Enterprise-grade AI assistant for finding trusted answers across your organization’s documents, spreadsheets, BI dashboards, and structured data — with citations and permissions built in.

## Overview (TL;DR)
- What it is: An enterprise knowledge assistant that retrieves and synthesizes answers with citations from your documents and data.
- Why it matters: Cuts search time, improves trust via citations, and respects permissions and roles.
- How it works: Ingest + chunk + embed; hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vectors with re‑ranking); optional LLM synthesis; robust fallbacks and logging.

Quick links
- Demo repo (Streamlit, Demo Mode): https://github.com/bolajil/VaultMind-Demo- (branch `demo`)
- Live demo URL: configure via Streamlit Community Cloud (Main file: `app.py`, Python 3.10)
- ICP (Ideal Customer Profile): see [docs/ICP.md](docs/ICP.md)
- One‑pager / Deck: coming soon (docs/)

## Why VaultMind
Teams waste hours digging through SharePoint, Confluence, PDFs, Excel, and BI dashboards. VaultMind unifies retrieval with hybrid search (vector + keyword + re‑ranking), enforces enterprise permissions, and generates cited answers so users trust results and admins stay in control.

- Trustworthy: Retrieval-grounded responses with citations and structured outputs
- Enterprise-ready: Role‑based permissions, approval workflows, robust fallbacks
- Flexible: Works with Weaviate (cloud) and FAISS (local) — multi‑vector adapters available

## Quickstart (Local)
Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ (recommended)
- Windows/macOS/Linux

1) Clone and set env
```
git clone <your_fork_or_repo_url>
cd genai-knowledge-assistant
copy .env.example .env.local   # on Windows (or: cp .env.example .env.local)
```

2) Install dependencies
```
pip install -r cloud_requirements.txt
```

3) Run the app (Streamlit)
```
streamlit run enhanced_streamlit_app.py
```

4) Optional: CLI & diagnostics
```
python scripts/diagnostics/diagnose_weaviate_query.py
python scripts/weaviate_schema_audit.py
python scripts/ingest/ingest_csv.py --help
```

Notes
- If you don’t have Weaviate set up, the system falls back to FAISS where possible.
- For email features in Agent Assistant, configure SMTP or Microsoft Graph in the UI or via `.env.local`.

---

## Demo Mode
Demo Mode is implemented for a one‑click experience with a bundled FAISS index and no external calls.
- Toggle via env: `DEMO_MODE=true`
- Default to FAISS, disable outbound web/API calls in demo
- Preloaded sample index from `template/index_data/test_index/`

You can host a live instance on Streamlit Community Cloud and/or mirror it on Hugging Face Spaces. Links will appear here after deployment.

Quick test locally (PowerShell):
```
$env:DEMO_MODE='true'; streamlit run enhanced_streamlit_app.py
```
